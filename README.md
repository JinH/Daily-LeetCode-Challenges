New year, new me. With 2018, right around the corner, one of my new year resolutions include starting this bold initiative of attempting to solve and discuss at least one coding question from https://leetcode.com/ per day. I view this repository as an alternative form of feedback analysis. I strongly believe that over time documenting my software development growth, areas of improvements, and my solutions (personal or collaborative) towards select challenges would assist me in breaking down some of my social barriers, improve my communication skills, build on old programming knowledge, and develop new coding skills. Cheers. 

I will try my best to give credit to where credit is due.
